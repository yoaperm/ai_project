### GA vs Brute Force Comparision
`ga_bf_comparision.py` is a Python application that compares the performance of a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** and **Brute-Force (BF)** search in solving optimization problems. The application evaluates both approaches in terms of their execution time, solution quality, and efficiency. It provides an interactive Streamlit interface for setting parameters, running comparisons, and visualizing the results.

### Installation

Install the required packages via pip:

```$ pip install matplotlib pandas streamlit```

### Usage

Run the script using Streamlit:


```$ streamlit run ga_bf_comparision.py```

### GA vs Brute Force Comparision
`ga_cga_space_comparision.py`  is a Python application designed to compare the performance and memory usage of a  **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**  and a  **Multi-Valued Compact Genetic Algorithm (MV-cGA)**. It uses an interactive Streamlit interface to allow users to configure parameters, execute the comparison, and visualize results. The focus is on evaluating execution time, memory consumption, and solution quality for optimization problems.

----------


### Installation

Ensure you have the required Python packages installed:

bash

Copy code

```$ pip install matplotlib pandas streamlit```

Also, include the  `mv_cga.py`  file in your working directory, which contains the implementation of the  `MultiValuedCompactGeneticAlgorithm`.

### Usage

Run the script using Streamlit:

```$ streamlit run ga_cga_space_comparision.py```
